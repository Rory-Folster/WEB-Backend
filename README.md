### WEB-Backend

#### Overview
The "WEB-Backend" is a Node.js Express-based backend designed for web development. It handles HTTP requests, routes endpoints, and interacts with a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of how to use the backend, the libraries and technologies it relies on, and its core functionality.

#### Usage

1. **Installation and Setup**
   - Clone or download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Rory-Folster/WEB-Backend).
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
   - Install the required Node.js packages by running:

     ```
     npm install
     ```

2. **MongoDB Setup**
   - Ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running on your system. You may need to set up a MongoDB database and configure connection details in the backend application.

3. **Running the Application**
   - Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
   - Start the Express server using the following command:

     ```
     npm start
     ```

4. **User Interaction**
   - The application exposes HTTP endpoints (API routes) for user interaction.
   - Interact with the backend by sending HTTP requests using tools like `curl`, Postman, or by integrating it with a frontend web application.

#### Libraries and Technologies Utilized

The backend makes use of the following libraries and technologies:

1. **Node.js**
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side.

2. **Express.js**
   - [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the creation of web routes, handling HTTP requests, and middleware.

3. **MongoDB**
   - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a popular NoSQL database. The backend application interacts with MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

4. **Node.js MongoDB Driver**
   - The Node.js MongoDB driver is used to connect to the MongoDB database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#### Functionality

The core functionality of the "WEB-Backend" includes:

1. **HTTP Routing**: The backend defines and routes HTTP endpoints, allowing clients to interact with the application through API requests.

2. **Database Interaction**: The backend interacts with a MongoDB database for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. This can include features like user registration, authentication, and data storage.

3. **User Authentication**: The application may include user authentication and authorization features, allowing secure access to certain API routes or resources.

4. **Data Validation and Serialization**: The backend typically includes data validation and serialization to ensure that data exchanged with clients is in the correct format.

5. **Middleware**: Middleware components can be used to add functionality to the HTTP request/response flow, such as logging, CORS handling, or error handling.

6. **Custom Business Logic**: Depending on the project requirements, the backend may contain custom business logic, such as calculating and processing data before returning responses.

Please note that the specific details and capabilities of the "WEB-Backend" may vary depending on the project's requirements and updates to the repository. It's advisable to refer to the repository's documentation and source code for the most up-to-date information.

If you have any further questions or need more detailed documentation on any specific aspect of the backend, feel free to ask.
